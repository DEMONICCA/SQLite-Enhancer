> [!NOTE]
> - SQLite Enhancer is a Magisk module designed to optimize the performance of SQLite databases on your Android device.
<hr/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features ‚ú®:
> 1. Full system database discovery with comprehensive scanning across all Android partitions including `/system`, `/vendor`, `/product`, `/data`, `/storage`, `/cache`, `/metadata`, `/mnt`, and `/apex` for complete database coverage. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 2. Advanced SQLite validation using format header detection to ensure only genuine SQLite databases are processed, preventing errors on false-positive `.db` files. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 3. Enhanced memory optimization with configurable cache sizing (8000 pages), memory-mapped I/O (`mmap_size`), and temporary storage management (`temp_store=MEMORY`) for maximum performance gains. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 4. Intelligent database lock detection with timeout protection to safely skip databases in use while preventing system hangs during optimization processes. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 5. Incremental vacuum implementation replacing full vacuum for faster processing with minimal system impact while maintaining optimization effectiveness. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 6. Real-time optimization tracking with database size measurement showing exact bytes saved per database and comprehensive statistics reporting. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 7. Robust error handling with multiple fallback search methods, timeout protection (60s per database), and detailed per-database status logging for reliability. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 8. Advanced performance tuning with optimized page size (4096 bytes), Write-Ahead Logging mode, normal synchronization, and incremental auto-vacuum for sustained database efficiency. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 9. Comprehensive logging system with timestamps, device information, scan progress, and detailed operation results saved to `/sdcard/Android/DB.log` for monitoring and troubleshooting. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 10. Processing limit safeguards and permission validation to prevent system overload while ensuring safe operation across diverse Android configurations and security contexts. ‚úîÔ∏è
<hr/>

> [!TIP]
> 1. Supports `Magisk` `KernelSU - NEXT` `APatch` dan `SukiSU`.
> 2. Minimum Android `9 sdk 28`.
> 3. Install [SQLite3 for Android](https://github.com/DEMONICCA/SQLite3-for-Android.git) first to get maximum results.
> 4. To run it `Termux` command `su -c DB`.
