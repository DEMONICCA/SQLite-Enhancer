> [!NOTE]
> - SQLite Enhancer is a Magisk module designed to optimize the performance of SQLite databases on your Android device.
<hr/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features ‚ú®:
> 1. Complete database defragmentation and optimization to tidy up structure, rebuild indexes, and update query planner statistics for maximum performance. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 2. Advanced performance tuning with Write-Ahead Logging for better concurrency, optimized sync mode, and configurable cache size (2000 pages) to dramatically improve database I/O operations. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 3. Intelligent auto-optimization feature that performs comprehensive database maintenance including statistics updates and index analysis (requires SQLite 3.18.0+). ‚úîÔ∏è
> 4. Automatic space management system that immediately reclaims unused pages to prevent database bloat and maintain optimal storage efficiency. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 5. Detailed operation tracking with timestamps, device information (model, kernel, SQLite version), and per-database status reports saved to `/sdcard/Android/DB.log`. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 6. Recursive scanning of `/data` and `/sdcard` directories using optimized busybox find to automatically locate all `.db` files for batch processing. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 7. Advanced access control that safely skips locked, corrupted, or permission-restricted databases while continuing optimization of accessible files. ‚úîÔ∏è
> 8. All optimization commands preserve existing data integrity while maximizing performance gains through SQLite's built-in ACID transaction safety. ‚úîÔ∏è
<hr/>

> [!TIP]
